Just playing around with bootstrap and javascript to get more comfortable with them. I've been taking the free code camp course and 
wanted to give some of what I've been learning a whirl. Obviously, the site isn't meant to be taken seriously. It was made to allow
me to tinker with bootstrap and to help me understand JS a bit more. 

The JS seems wonky, but I like how the bootstrap came out. I need to figure out how to get the background image not to stack when
viewed on a mobile screen. I'll sort that out with my next attempt. So far, so good.
